# Code Walkthrough

## 1. Imports and Structure Definitions

```vb
Imports System.IO
Imports System.Math
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices
Imports System.Text
```
These lines import necessary namespaces that provide functionalities for input/output operations, mathematical calculations, and other utilities.

### 1.1 Turret Structure

```vb
Public Structure Turret
```
Here, we define a structure named `Turret`. A structure is a value type that can hold data and related functionality.

#### 1.1.1 Member Variables

```vb
Public Pen As Pen
Public Center As PointF
Public Length As Integer
Public AngleInDegrees As Single
```
- **Pen**: This variable defines the style (color, width) used when drawing the turret.
- **Center**: A `PointF` structure that holds the coordinates of the turret's center.
- **Length**: An integer representing the length of the turret's barrel.
- **AngleInDegrees**: A single-precision floating-point number that specifies the angle of the turret in degrees.

[Back to Index](#index-of-sections-and-subsections)

#### 1.1.2 Constructor

```vb
Public Sub New(pen As Pen, center As PointF, length As Integer, angleInDegrees As Single)
    Me.Pen = pen
    Me.Center = center
    Me.Length = length
    Me.AngleInDegrees = angleInDegrees
End Sub
```
This constructor initializes the turret's properties. The `Me` keyword refers to the current instance of the structure.

[Back to Index](#index-of-sections-and-subsections)

#### 1.1.3 Draw Method

```vb
Public Sub Draw(g As Graphics)
```
This method is responsible for rendering the turret on the screen. It accepts a `Graphics` object, which is used for drawing.

```vb
g.SmoothingMode = Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.AntiAlias
```
This line sets the smoothing mode to `AntiAlias`, which makes the edges of shapes smoother.

```vb
Dim Diameter As Integer = 75
```
We define a diameter for the turret's base.

```vb

g.FillEllipse(Brushes.Gray,
New Rectangle(Center.X - Diameter / 2,
              Center.Y - Diameter / 2,
              Diameter,
              Diameter))

```

This line draws a gray ellipse (circle) at the turret's center, calculated to center the ellipse based on its diameter.

```vb

DrawLineFromCenterGivenLenghtAndAngle(g, Pen, Center, Length, AngleInDegrees)

```

This calls another method to draw the barrel of the turret based on its center, length, and angle.

[Back to Index](#index-of-sections-and-subsections)

#### 1.1.4 Line Drawing Method

```vb

Private Sub DrawLineFromCenterGivenLenghtAndAngle(g As Graphics,
                                                  pen As Pen,
                                                  center As PointF,
                                                  length As Integer,
                                                  angleInDegrees As Single)

```
This private method calculates the endpoint of the turret's barrel based on the angle provided.

```vb

Dim angleInRadians As Single = angleInDegrees * (Math.PI / 180)

```

This converts the angle from degrees to radians because trigonometric functions in VB use radians.

```vb

Dim EndPoint As PointF

EndPoint = New PointF(center.X + length * Cos(angleInRadians),
                      center.Y + length * Sin(angleInRadians))

```

Using trigonometry, we calculate the endpoint of the barrel based on the center point and the length of the barrel.


```vb

g.DrawLine(pen, center, EndPoint)

```

Finally, this line draws the line (the barrel) from the center to the calculated endpoint.

### 1.2 ProjectileManager Structure

```vb
Public Structure ProjectileManager
```
This structure manages the projectiles fired from the turret.

#### 1.2.1 Projectile Structure

[Back to Index](#index-of-sections-and-subsections)

##### 1.2.1.2 Constructor

```vb
Public Sub New(brush As Brush, width As Double, height As Double, velocity As Single, center As PointF, length As Integer, angleInDegrees As Single)
```
This constructor initializes a new projectile with the provided parameters.

```vb
Dim AngleInRadians As Single = angleInDegrees * (Math.PI / 180)
```
Again, we convert the angle from degrees to radians.

```vb
X = center.X + length * Cos(AngleInRadians)
Y = center.Y + length * Sin(AngleInRadians)
```
The initial position of the projectile is set based on the center point and the angle.

[Back to Index](#index-of-sections-and-subsections)

##### 1.2.1.3 Velocity Calculation

```vb
Select Case angleInDegrees
```
This statement determines the projectile's velocity based on the angle it is fired at. Each case sets the X and Y components of the velocity vector.

```vb
Creation = Now()
```
This line records the current time when the projectile is created.

[Back to Index](#index-of-sections-and-subsections)

##### 1.2.1.4 UpdateMovement Method

```vb
Public Sub UpdateMovement(ByVal deltaTime As TimeSpan)
```
This method updates the position of the projectile based on its velocity and the elapsed time since the last update.

```vb
X += Velocity.X * deltaTime.TotalSeconds
Y += Velocity.Y * deltaTime.TotalSeconds
```
These lines calculate the new position of the projectile.

[Back to Index](#index-of-sections-and-subsections)

##### 1.2.1.5 Rounding Functions

```vb
Public Function NearestX() As Integer
    Return RoundToNearest(X)
End Function
```
This function rounds the projectile's X position to the nearest integer.

```vb
Private Function RoundToNearest(ByVal value As Double) As Integer
    Return CInt(Math.Round(value))
End Function
```
This private function handles the rounding logic for any double value.

```
- **Pen**: This variable defines the style (color, width) used when drawing the turret.
- **Center**: A `PointF` structure that holds the coordinates of the turret's center.
- **Length**: An integer representing the length of the turret's barrel.
- **AngleInDegrees**: A single-precision floating-point number that specifies the angle of the turret in degrees.

#### Constructor

```vb
Public Sub New(pen As Pen, center As PointF, length As Integer, angleInDegrees As Single)
    Me.Pen = pen
    Me.Center = center
    Me.Length = length
    Me.AngleInDegrees = angleInDegrees
End Sub
```
This constructor initializes the turret's properties. The `Me` keyword refers to the current instance of the structure.

### Draw Method

```vb
Public Sub Draw(g As Graphics)
```
This method is responsible for rendering the turret on the screen. It accepts a `Graphics` object, which is used for drawing.

```vb
g.SmoothingMode = Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.AntiAlias
```
This line sets the smoothing mode to `AntiAlias`, which makes the edges of shapes smoother.

```vb
Dim Diameter As Integer = 75
```
We define a diameter for the turret's base.

```vb
g.FillEllipse(Brushes.Gray, New Rectangle(Center.X - Diameter / 2, Center.Y - Diameter / 2, Diameter, Diameter))
```
This line draws a gray ellipse (circle) at the turret's center, calculated to center the ellipse based on its diameter.

```vb
DrawLineFromCenterGivenLenghtAndAngle(g, Pen, Center, Length, AngleInDegrees)
```
This calls another method to draw the barrel of the turret based on its center, length, and angle.

### Line Drawing Method

```vb

```
This private method calculates the endpoint of the turret's barrel based on the angle provided.

```vb
Dim angleInRadians As Single = angleInDegrees * (Math.PI / 180)
```
This converts the angle from degrees to radians because trigonometric functions in VB use radians.

```vb
Dim EndPoint As PointF
EndPoint = New PointF(center.X + length * Cos(angleInRadians), center.Y + length * Sin(angleInRadians))
```
Using trigonometry, we calculate the endpoint of the barrel based on the center point and the length of the barrel.
