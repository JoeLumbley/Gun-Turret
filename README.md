# Code Walkthrough


Welcome to the detailed walkthrough of the Gun Turret code! In this lesson, we will go through the code line by line, explaining each part in a way that is easy to understand. This project simulates a turret that can rotate and fire projectiles. Letâ€™s dive in!

## Turret Structure

### Definition
```vb
Public Structure Turret
```
Here, we define a structure named `Turret`. A structure is a value type that can hold data and related functionality. This structure will encapsulate all the properties and methods related to our turret.

### Member Variables
```vb
Public Pen As Pen
Public UnderlightPen As Pen
Public UnderlightBrush As Brush
Public Center As Point
Public Length As Integer
Public AngleInDegrees As Single
Public TimeToNextFire As TimeSpan
Public LastFireTime As DateTime
```
- **Pen**: This variable defines the style (color, width) used when drawing the turret.
- **UnderlightPen**: Similar to `Pen`, but for drawing an under-light effect.
- **UnderlightBrush**: A brush used for filling the under-light effect.
- **Center**: A `Point` structure that holds the coordinates of the turret's center.
- **Length**: An integer representing the length of the turret's barrel.
- **AngleInDegrees**: A single-precision floating-point number that specifies the angle of the turret in degrees.
- **TimeToNextFire**: A `TimeSpan` representing the time until the turret can fire again.
- **LastFireTime**: The last time the turret fired a projectile.

### Constructor

```vb

Public Sub New(pen As Pen,
               center As Point,
               length As Integer,
               angleInDegrees As Single,
               reloadTime As TimeSpan)

    Me.Pen = pen
    Me.Center = center
    Me.Length = length
    Me.AngleInDegrees = angleInDegrees
    Me.TimeToNextFire = reloadTime
    UnderlightPen = New Pen(Color.FromArgb(128, Color.Blue), 23)
    UnderlightBrush = New SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(128, Color.Blue))

End Sub

```

This constructor initializes the turretâ€™s properties:
- **Me**: Refers to the current instance of the structure.
- The parameters allow us to set the initial values for the `Pen`, `Center`, `Length`, `AngleInDegrees`, and `TimeToNextFire`.
- The `UnderlightPen` and `UnderlightBrush` are initialized with a semi-transparent blue color.

### Draw Method

```vb

Public Sub Draw(g As Graphics)
    ' Draw a line of given length from the given center point at a given angle.

    Dim Diameter As Integer = 75

    Dim UnderLightRectangle As New Rectangle(Center.X - Diameter / 2,
                                             Center.Y - Diameter / 2,
                                             Diameter, Diameter)
    UnderLightRectangle.Inflate(2, 2)

    g.FillEllipse(UnderlightBrush,
                  UnderLightRectangle)

    DrawEllipseWithRadialGradient(g,
                                  Center,

                                  Diameter, Diameter)

    GradRect.Inflate(4, 4)

    path.AddEllipse(GradRect)

    ' Create the radial gradient brush
    Dim brush As New PathGradientBrush(path)

    ' Set the center color (highlight)
    brush.CenterColor = Color.White

    brush.SurroundColors = New Color() {Color.Black}

    brush.CenterPoint = New PointF(Center.X - Diameter / 4,
                                   Center.Y - Diameter / 4)

    ' Fill the ellipse with the radial gradient brush
    g.FillEllipse(brush, New Rectangle(Center.X - Diameter / 2,
                                       Center.Y - Diameter / 2,
                                       Diameter, Diameter))

        Projectiles.FireProjectile(Turret.Center, Turret.AngleInDegrees)
        Turret.LastFireTime = Now
    End If
End Sub
```
- This method checks if it is time to fire a projectile.
- If enough time has passed since the last shot, it plays the gunshot sound.
- It calls the `FireProjectile` method of the `ProjectileManager` to create a new projectile at the turret's center and angle.
- Updates the `LastFireTime` to the current time.

    If Projectiles.IsColliding(Target) Then
        Player.PlayOverlapping("explosion")
        TargetBrush = Brushes.Red
        Projectiles.RemoveCollidingProjectiles(Target)
    Else
        TargetBrush = Brushes.Black
    End If
End Sub
```
- This method checks for collisions between projectiles and the target rectangle.
- If a collision is detected, it plays the explosion sound and changes the target's color to red.
- It removes any colliding projectiles from the game.
- If no collision is detected, it sets the target color back to black.

### InitializeTimer Method
```vb
Private Sub InitializeTimer()
    Timer1.Interval = 15
    Timer1.Start()
End Sub
```
- This method sets up the timer to tick every 15 milliseconds, which controls the update rate of the game.
- Starts the timer to begin the game loop.

### InitializeSounds Method
```vb
Private Sub InitializeSounds()
    Dim FilePath As String = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "gunshot.mp3")
    Player.AddOverlapping("gunshot", FilePath)
    Player.SetVolumeOverlapping("gunshot", 1000)

    FilePath = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "ambientnoise.mp3")
    Player.AddSound("ambientnoise", FilePath)
    Player.SetVolume("ambientnoise", 5)

    FilePath = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "explosion.mp3")
    Player.AddOverlapping("explosion", FilePath)
    Player.SetVolumeOverlapping("explosion", 700)
End Sub
```
- This method initializes the sounds used in the game.
- It sets up the file paths for the sound files and adds them to the audio player.
- Adjusts the volume levels for each sound.

### CreateSoundFiles Method
```vb
Private Sub CreateSoundFiles()
    Dim FilePath As String = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "gunshot.mp3")
    CreateFileFromResource(FilePath, My.Resources.Resource1.gunshot003)

    FilePath = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "ambientnoise.mp3")
    CreateFileFromResource(FilePath, My.Resources.Resource1.ambientnoise)

    FilePath = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "explosion.mp3")
    CreateFileFromResource(FilePath, My.Resources.Resource1.explosion)
End Sub
```
- This method creates sound files from embedded resources if they do not already exist.
- It sets the file paths and calls `CreateFileFromResource` for each sound.

### CreateFileFromResource Method
```vb
Private Sub CreateFileFromResource(filepath As String, resource As Byte())
    Try
        If Not IO.File.Exists(filepath) Then
            IO.File.WriteAllBytes(filepath, resource)
        End If
    Catch ex As Exception
        Debug.Print($"Error creating file: {ex.Message}")
    End Try
End Sub
```
- This method writes the byte array resource to a file at the specified path.
- It checks if the file already exists to avoid overwriting.
- If an error occurs, it prints the error message to the debug console.



This code represents a simple yet effective simulation of a turret that can rotate and fire projectiles. Each structure and method is designed to encapsulate specific functionality, making the code modular and easier to understand. By breaking down the code line by line, we can see how each part contributes to the overall behavior of the turret and projectile manager. Feel free to experiment with the code, change parameters, and see how it affects the behavior of the turret and its projectiles. Happy coding!
